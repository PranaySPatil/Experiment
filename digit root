The digital root (also repeated digital sum) of a non-negative integer is the (single digit) value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

For example, the digital root of 65,536 is 7, because 6 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 25 and 2 + 5 = 7.

Digital roots can be calculated with congruences in modular arithmetic rather than by adding up all the digits, a procedure that can save time in the case of very large numbers.

Digital roots can be used as a sort of checksum. For example, since the digital root of a sum is always equal to the digital root of the sum of the summands' digital roots.[needs copy edit] A person adding long columns of large numbers will often find it reassuring to apply casting out nines to his resultâ€”knowing that this technique will catch the majority of errors
